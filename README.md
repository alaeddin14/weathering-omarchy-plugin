# Weathering

A weather widget for the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) bar. One pill in the
bar; one panel with a sectioned layout: a current-conditions hero, metric cells
(wind, humidity, pressure, UV index, air quality, sun), an hourly strip, and a
7-day forecast. Weather data comes from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)
and [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) — no API key, no account.

## Features

| Section | Shows |
|---------|-------|
| **Current** | condition glyph, big temperature, location (click to search), feels-like / wind / precipitation chance |
| **Metrics** | filled cells: wind (speed + compass arrow), humidity, pressure, UV index, air quality, sun (rise/set) — level bars on humidity / pressure / UV |
| **Hourly** | six upcoming cells, every other hour by default (NOW highlighted): time, condition glyph, temperature, precipitation probability, day MAX readout |
| **7-day** | one cell per day (today highlighted): condition, hi/lo |
| **Air quality** | US AQI number with health category (Good → Hazardous) plus PM2.5 / PM10 |
| **Location** | click the location label to search cities (Open-Meteo geocoding); empty commit returns to IP auto-detect |
| **Color** | every condition has its own glyph color in the bar, hero, hourly and 7-day strips; UV and air quality tint by severity — on both light and dark themes (`colorIcon`) |
| **Alerts** | active NWS watches and warnings (US), listed above the hero; a warning turns the bar pill urgent |
| **Radar** | right-click the pill (or the panel's RADAR action) for the animated NWS radar loop |

The panel uses the theme's popup surface, so it follows dark and light themes.
Everything is metric or imperial aware (auto / metric / imperial, or per your
locale). The hourly strip and air-quality section can be hidden via the
`showHourly` and `showAirQuality` settings (see [Configure](#configure)).

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/howdyitskyle/weathering-omarchy-plugin.git --enable
```

`omarchy plugin add` installs safely: it clones the repo to a temporary
folder, **validates the `manifest.json`** against Omarchy's plugin schema, and
refuses to add anything invalid. It also refuses to overwrite an existing
install — if the plugin id is already in use, it stops and tells you to use
`omarchy plugin update` instead. Only after validation does it move the plugin
into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<id>/` and (with `--enable`) ask where to place
the bar pill.

Then move it where you like on the bar (it lands in the right section by
default):

```sh
omarchy bar move io.github.howdyitskyle.weathering --section center
```

## Use

Click the pill to open or close the panel. Press Escape to close it.
Middle-click refreshes; **right-click opens the radar loop** in mpv. Inside the
panel, click the location label (top right) to search for a city; pressing
Escape or committing an empty search returns to automatic IP-based location,
and the RADAR action beside it opens the same loop as right-click.

The pill shows the condition glyph and the current temperature, and every
condition gets its own color: amber for clear sun, periwinkle for a clear
night, pale gold for partly cloudy, blue-grey for overcast, grey for fog, light
blue for showers, deeper blue for rain, violet for storms, pale cyan for sleet,
and near-white for snow. Set `colorIcon` to `false` for a plain monochrome
pill.

Bind a key if you like, in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` (Hyprland's
bindings file — `bindd` is a superkey chord binding, so this one is
`SUPER + CTRL + W`):

```lua
bindd = SUPER CTRL, W, Weathering, exec, omarchy-shell shell toggle io.github.howdyitskyle.weathering '{}'
```

## Location

The plugin shares its location with the built-in `omarchy.weather` widget via
`~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/weather.json`, so setting a location in either
one keeps both in sync. Without a configured location the panel auto-detects
from your IP address.

## Configure

`omarchy bar` › the Weathering widget has these settings:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `unit` | `auto` | `auto` / `metric` / `imperial` |
| `refreshMinutes` | `15` | refresh interval, 5–120 min |
| `showHourly` | `true` | show the hourly strip |
| `showAirQuality` | `true` | show the air-quality section |
| `showMetrics` | `true` | show the METRICS grid (wind, humidity, pressure, UV) |
| `showSun` | `true` | show the sun rise/set cell in the metrics grid |
| `show7day` | `true` | show the 7-day forecast strip |
| `showFeelsLike` | `true` | show the feels-like stat in the header |
| `hourlyCells` | `6` | number of hourly forecast cells to show (3–6) |
| `hourlyStep` | `2` | hours between hourly cells (1–6); 2 means six cells cover twelve hours |
| `colorIcon` | `true` | tint the bar and hero glyphs by condition |
| `showAlerts` | `true` | show active NWS alerts (US only) |
| `alertNotifications` | `true` | notify on new severe warnings |
| `alertsMinutes` | `5` | alert check interval, 1–30 min |
| `radarStation` | `""` | NWS radar station id (e.g. `KTBW`); empty resolves it from your location |

Settings are inline on the widget's bar-layout entry in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. For example, to force imperial units, refresh
every 10 minutes, hide the air-quality section, and show only 4 hourly cells,
add the keys to the entry:

```json
{
  "bar": {
    "layout": {
      "center": [
        {
          "id": "omarchy.clock"
        },
        {
          "id": "io.github.howdyitskyle.weathering",
          "unit": "imperial",
          "refreshMinutes": 10,
          "showAirQuality": false,
          "hourlyCells": 4
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The entry lives wherever you placed the widget (in the example above, in the
bar's `center` layout, next to the clock). `shell.json` hot-reloads on save, so
no restart is needed — the change takes effect immediately. You can also set
these from the settings form in `omarchy bar` rather than editing the file by
hand.

## Data

Most data comes from Open-Meteo's free APIs (`api.open-meteo.com`,
`air-quality-api.open-meteo.com`, `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com`): the daily
forecast (hourly strip + 7-day), current conditions, air quality, and city
search. **wttr.in** (`wttr.in`) is also used — it provides current conditions
when no location is configured (IP auto-detection) and the current-condition
fallback, and it answers the IP auto-location query. There is no account, key,
or rate plan for either service.

The panel fetches on open, on location change, and on a refresh timer that
runs every `refreshMinutes` (even while the panel is closed) so the bar pill
stays current. When a location is configured, the Open-Meteo forecast is the
authoritative current-condition source; without one, wttr.in fills the hero.

**The National Weather Service** (`api.weather.gov`, US only, no key) supplies
two things: the radar station serving your coordinates, resolved once and
cached, and active alerts. Alerts poll on their own `alertsMinutes` clock
rather than with the forecast, since a warning is worth catching sooner than a
temperature. The radar animation itself is an NWS RIDGE II loop
(`radar.weather.gov`), opened in mpv rather than downloaded.

A failed alert fetch leaves whatever is already on screen: an alert is only
cleared by a response that successfully says nothing is active, never by a
network error. NWS marks watches and warnings alike as `Severe`, so only
warnings (and anything `Extreme`) turn the pill urgent or raise a notification
— a watch is listed in the panel and otherwise stays quiet.

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin remove io.github.howdyitskyle.weathering
```

Removal is safe. Omarchy first disables and unloads the plugin from the
running `omarchy-shell`, then — because a git-installed plugin's source lives
upstream — it deletes the local copy. If you instead installed the folder
manually (no git repo), the folder is **backed up** to
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/.io.github.howdyitskyle.weathering.bak.<timestamp>`
rather than deleted, so you can recover it if needed.

## Security

Omarchy plugins run as **unsandboxed code** inside your long-lived
`omarchy-shell` process, with your user's permissions. Only install plugins you
trust, and review the source before enabling. This plugin reads weather data
from Open-Meteo, wttr.in, and the National Weather Service over HTTPS and
shares your location via `omarchy-weather-location`.

It runs two commands on your behalf: `mpv` for the radar window, and
`omarchy-notification-send` for alert notifications. Both go through a shell,
so both are constructed carefully — a radar station id must be three or four
letters before it is used, and alert text from the NWS is shell-quoted rather
than trusted. No location, station, or coordinate is committed to this
repository.
